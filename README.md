# Argentum
Latin word for "Silver", whose chemical element is **AG**.  This project is an experimental
language aimed in understanding how compilers are structured and built.

The work will be modeled after [crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com). Although, the specifications
herein will not be entirely in adherence to the book since we will be developing in Rust.

There will likely be two CLI thin wrappers around core function:

1. Script mode - Give a path to a file, it reads the file and executes it.
2. REPL - run interactively.
