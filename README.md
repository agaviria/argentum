# Argentum
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/agaviria/argentum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/agaviria/argentum)

'Argentum' is the latin word for "Silver", whose chemical element is **AG**.
This project is experimental. It aims in understanding how interpreters and
compilers are structured and built.

This work is inspired by [crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com) book. Although, the specifications
herein will not be entirely in adherence to the book.

There will likely be two CLI thin wrappers around core function:

1. Script mode - Give a path to a file, it reads the file and executes it.
2. REPL - run interactively.

Syntax, is currently work-in-progress.
